# Hiring a Fiverr Developer for the Pack 3 Website

This document explains how to use Fiverr to hire someone to build the Squarespace site.

---

## How Fiverr Works

1. **Find a seller** - Search for "Squarespace website design" or post your job
2. **Message first** - Contact 2-3 sellers to share your design and confirm scope
3. **Pay upfront** - Money is held in escrow (Fiverr holds it)
4. **Seller delivers** - You review the work
5. **Request revisions** - Most gigs include 1-3 revision rounds
6. **Approve and release payment** - Seller gets paid when you're satisfied

## Expected Cost

For a site this size (8 sections, ~10 images):

| Seller Level | Price Range | What You Get |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Budget | $100-200 | Basic build, may need more direction |
| Mid-range | $200-400 | Clean build, good communication, revisions |
| Premium | $400-600 | Fast delivery, polished, video walkthrough |

**Recommendation:** Budget $200-400 for a quality build with revisions.

---

## Expected Timeline

| Seller Type | Timeline |
|-------------|----------|
| Budget seller | 5-10 days |
| Mid-range seller | 3-7 days |
| Premium/rush delivery | 1-3 days (costs extra) |

**Realistic expectation:** 5-7 days including revisions

---

## Can They Work Incrementally?

Yes, but it's not the default. Options:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Milestones** | Pay per section, see progress | Not all sellers offer this |
| **Multiple small gigs** | Maximum control | More overhead, coordination |
| **Single delivery + revisions** | Simplest, most common | You wait until it's all done |

**Tip:** Ask sellers upfront if they'll share progress screenshots midway through.

## What to Send the Seller

### Required:
1. **Screenshots of the design** - Open `index.html` in your browser, take full-page screenshots
2. **Images folder** - Zip up the `images/` folder and send it

### Optional but helpful:
3. **The HTML file** (`index.html`) - They can open it in their browser
4. **The build guide** (`SQUARESPACE-GUIDE-NO-CSS.md`) - Shows section structure

### How to take full-page screenshots:
- **Chrome:** Right-click → Inspect → Cmd+Shift+P → type "screenshot" → "Capture full size screenshot"
- **Firefox:** Right-click → Take Screenshot → Save full page
- **Mac:** Use a tool like CleanShot or Shottr
- **Simple option:** Just scroll and take multiple screenshots

## Questions to Ask Sellers Before Hiring

Send these questions when you first message a seller:

1. "Can you build this using only native Squarespace blocks, no custom CSS?"
2. "Will I be able to edit all text and images myself after you're done?"
3. "Do you offer a walkthrough video showing me how to make edits?"
4. "Can you share progress screenshots midway through?"
5. "How many revision rounds are included?"

---

## Red Flags (Avoid These Sellers)

- **Wants to use custom code** - You won't be able to maintain it
- **No Squarespace-specific reviews** - May not know the platform well
- **Won't communicate before ordering** - Poor sign for collaboration
- **Promises < 24 hour delivery** - Too rushed for quality work
- **Asks for payment outside Fiverr** - Scam, no buyer protection
- **Copy/paste responses** - Not reading your requirements

---

## Green Flags (Good Signs)

- **Portfolio shows similar Squarespace sites** - Relevant experience
- **Reviews mention "easy to edit" or "great handoff"** - Cares about your independence
- **Offers revision rounds** - Willing to get it right
- **Responds thoughtfully to your questions** - Actually read your brief
- **Willing to share progress midway** - Good communication
- **Asks clarifying questions** - Taking the project seriously

## After You Hire: What to Expect

### During the project:
1. Seller may ask clarifying questions - respond promptly
2. Ask for a progress check around day 3-4
3. They'll deliver a link to preview the site

### At delivery:
1. Review every section against your design
2. Check mobile view (resize your browser or use phone)
3. Test that you can edit text and images
4. Make a list of changes needed

### Revisions:
1. Be specific: "The About section heading should be green (#2d6a4f), not black"
2. Use screenshots to show what you mean
3. Most gigs include 2-3 revision rounds

### Final handoff:
1. Get the walkthrough video
2. Confirm you have admin access to the Squarespace account
3. Make a test edit yourself before approving
